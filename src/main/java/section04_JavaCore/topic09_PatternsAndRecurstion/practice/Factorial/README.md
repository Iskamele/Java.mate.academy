Implement a method `getFibonacciNumber(int n)` that will return number on `n`-th position in fibonacci series (starting from 0).

In fibonacci series, next number is the sum of previous two numbers.

For example, `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55` etc.

The first two numbers of fibonacci series are `0` and `1`.

```
Example input: n = 8
```

```
Output result = 21;
```
