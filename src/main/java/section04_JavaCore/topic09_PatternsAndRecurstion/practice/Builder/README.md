**Given class Plane. Design class PlaneBuilder, that will implement pattern Builder.**

-   Plane should have at least 5 fields.
-   Add all necessary changes that are required in order to implement "Builder".

P.S. In tests we expect Builder implementation, where class Plane has a private constructor, which takes builder object as input. Class Builder is inner static with method "build" where private constructor of Plane is called.
