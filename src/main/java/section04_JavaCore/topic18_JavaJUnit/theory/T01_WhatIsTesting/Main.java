        1. What is Testing?
        2. What are the benefits of tests?
        3. What are the types of tests?

        Testing is a test of the correspondence between the actual
        and expected behavior of a program, carried out on a concrete
        set of tests chosen in a certain way. Simple put â€” testing
        is checking whether everything is working as expected in your program.

        Types of Testing:
        1. UNIT TESTING
        2. INTEGRATION TESTING
        3. REGRESSION TESTING
        4. SMOKE TESTING
        5. ALPHA TESTING
        6. BETA TESTING
        7. SYSTEM TESTING
        8. STRESS TESTING
        9. PERFORMANCE TESTING
        AND MANY OTHERS

        As developers, we should write unit tests for our code.
        It's a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code
        that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming
        languages, the unit is a function (or a method in Java) or class
        or a property. Again, it is important that the unit is isolated
        for the testing to be done independently.

        One of the most popular testing frameworks for Java is JUnit.
